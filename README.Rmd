Synthetic data for hackathon.

Run the Shiny app in `shinyapp.R` or see function definition in `simulator.R`.

See bottom of this file (`trajectories.png`) for an example plot.

## Parameters

- Ordinal scale from 0--10
- Assume it is 'pain' but could be any symptom ot outcome (label it 'pain' for now)
- Follow-up for 6 months
- Assume in first iteration that people report every day
- Groups of people
    - High disease severity
    - Moderate disease severity
    - Low disease severity
    - ...where 'severity' means the average level of pain
- But people will _transition_ between these levels of disease activity
- Assume that the transition probabilities are known
    - Usually in response to treatment
    - If high or medium severity, clinical treatment will want to get that under control
    - Change in treatments 6 weeks to 3 months for 'high'
    - Then can have a rule that treatment pushes (e.g. 2/3 of) people from high to moderate/low state
- Certain people are more likely to go back to high disease severity
- **Treatment is modelled in the background but not recorded explicitly in the data**
- Some patients more likely to respond to serial treatments, others not (see 2/3 above)

### Flares

- If latent continuous variable increases by a certain amount in a certain window, then there is a high probability (not a guarantee) of recording an onset flare event – which is a discrete event.
- Duration of flare event – how long does it last for?
- Do they return to where they were at the end of the flare or is it a changepoint.
- Some/all flares are not predictable in advance. So flares could be a point process that changes the latent trajectory, rather than the other way round.
- But participants may try to approach the problem of trying to predict from the ‘pre-flare period’.
    - So flare can induce sometimes but not always a pre-flare ramping up period. Either linear ramping up in latent variable.
    - Or increase in variability/amplitude? Or both.
- Flares are ~~self-exciting process~~ – patients continually have flares until they are treated. Or just the hazard rate of flare increases with latent state of disease activity.
- Low disease activity: 4 or 5
- Definition of a flare is 3 or more units, a sudden increase and sustained for a fixed minimum duration.
- Challenge is not to find the flares but just not to miss them with their algorithm.
- Model as a directed acyclic graph
- Write up as a paper(?) or parametrizable simulator to provide e.g. MSc students access to data. With Shiny interface.
- Shoei is looking after GitHub page with resources. So can share as web app or R package.

## Revised simulation with treatments

-	Can we overlay treatments and show
-	Binary indicator of on treatment or not
-	Precondition for treatment: should be in medium or high pain state (not low)
-	If in high state, go onto treatment
    -	After 3 or 6 months, side-effects or non-effect of teatment
    -	Once formally non-responded, switch to another treatment
    -	Reset clock and roll the dice on treatment effectiveness + side effects (two separate things but both would cause change after 3-6 months)
    -	Do people every come off treatment? If it works well, then no, not for the purpose of this exercise. So people in medium or high state have a high probability of being treated, and if it works, then high probability of going down to medium or low. And if so, then assuming no side effects, then just stay on it.
    -	Make treatment keep pain down for 1 month (not just instantaneous effect). Realistically 3-6 months but might not get captured in 6 month followup period. No need to assume anything like gradual treatment resistance. It either works or it doesn’t.
    -	Speed of response – wash in time. Some people respond rapidly, slowly or not at all. Do you respond in 2 weeks or in 3 months?

In clinical reality, when we have a new patient, we really can’t predict what their trajectory will be, even if we know their age, sex or ethnicity. So just assume phenotype, set at baseline, but not observable or not directly correlated with observable baseline variables.

No need to connect genotype with treatment. Treatment effectiveness can just be a roll of the dice.

See `simulator.R`.
